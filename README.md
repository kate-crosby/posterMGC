## A repo for Crosby et al.'s poster for Maize Genetics Conference 2015 in St. Charles Illinois

Prepped in Overleaf. Tex, bib, image files + pdf for printer.

Poster is sized at 48 x 48 inches, and I messed around with the .sty and .tex template files a bit to get this layout - original creator of template still in .tex file.

Download as a new project in Rstudio and poster pdf can be compiled.
